This was my final project for the Mobile App Development course at the University of Virginia in the Fall semester of 2022.

The project is an iOS app and the main feature is a daily music practice audio journal in which the user can record a bit of their practice, which is saved in a list with the date of the recording. They can then listen back to their recordings to see how they've improved over time.

Tools used: Swift, Xcode.
